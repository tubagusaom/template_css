You can find all available icons you can use on&nbsp;http://fontawesome.io/icons/</p>\n<h4>\n\tHow do I change the contact form information?</h4>\n<p>\tThe contact form is easy to edit. Open the php folder and the only php file there, edit it and replace mail@domain.com with your address. Please note! We&#39;ve been using this exact same php for all our items, so if you don&#39;t recieve an email, please contact your hosting provider and request they enable all necessary php functions. Our contact form has been tested by over 20.000 customers and the only times an issue appeared it was due to the hosting company.</p>\n<h4>\n\tI want to make the page even faster, how do I do that?</h4>\n<p>\tFirst, create the page as you need it. Then, let&#39;s say you don&#39;t use the news, store and blog sections. Open framework.css and remove those elements completely by using CTRL + F or CMD + F to find the news, store, blog chapters and then simply delete them.</p>\n<h4>\n\tI don&#39;t want to use AJAX. How do I remove it?&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\tOpen custom.js and delete the last function on the page. It should be around line 739 just under the setTimeout(init_template,0);. Remvoe everything except for the very last }); on the page.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tHow do I change the settings to an image slider?</h4>\n<p>\tAll image sliders on our page are are found in custom.js use ctrl+f or cmd+f to find //Owl Carousel Sliders. Add yours inside the settimeout function. We are usign owlCarousel 2.2.1 (&nbsp;https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/docs/started-welcome.html )</p>\n<h4>\n\tHow can I convert this to a WordPress Theme or PhoneGap / Cordova Application?</h4>\n<p>\tBy default our item is HTML Site template, but it uses basic, simple html and css that is valid for both WordPress and PhoneGap. you can convert this to both of them by requesting the help of a freelance over at&nbsp;https://studio.envato.com/</p>\n<p>\t<strong>How do I remove the settings sidebar, demo css and demo js. Why is it even in here?!</strong></p>\n<p>\tNormally we deleted all demo code for production purposes. But some of our customers always requested these features to be accessible to them. Therefore, we left the code in there, for everyone to have access to. You can however and it is recommended you delete this to reduce the page load on the code. This can be done in the following way.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;<strong>Settings Menu 3 -</strong> Remove Menu 3 from the HTML pages.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>&nbsp;DEMO CSS - </strong>The demo CSS is added to line 5440 in framework.css. You can remove that completely.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>&nbsp;DEMO JS</strong> - The demo js is found in custom.js on lines 12 to 73. You can delete that as well.</p>\n"},{"title": "Secondary Classes","id": "secondary_classes","content": "<p>\tTo better understand the incredible flexibility our item uses, we&#39;ll use certian terms along the way, here is where we define those terms. This page is for all users, regardless of how proficient or experienced they are. We used simple terms in the idea that not all our customers will be pro&#39;s, and we believe everyone should be able to use our product.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Secondary Classes</strong></p>\n<p>\tThe secondary classes are something that make our item much more flexbile, and lighter in weight than anything our competition has provided. A secondary class to a main class. Can be used multiple times in a div with different properties. For example, changing colors, font sizes, margins, etc.</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;main-class secondary-class-1 secondary-class-2 secondar-class-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>But why do you use them? Why not hard code colors and sizes and fonts into css?! Why do I choose?</strong></p>\n<p>\tIt&#39;s simple. UltraMobile uses a lot of features, and like yourself, we want some of those features to look in a way, maybe you want them to look differently.</p>\n<p>\tAn instant example. We have a lot of button variations, used in different places with different styles. A button takes about 5 lines of code in CSS. Which doesn&#39;t ammount to much space. But, when you have over 100 pages, with a lot of button styles and different colors, adding just 5 lines of code to each button would result in over 500 lines of code in CSS. Making the item rigid, incredibly hard to customize, and increasing it&#39;s weight tenfold. Having reusable classes allows us to create a class, like a color for example, that can be applied in the HTML however many times you want, without increasing the page size and decreasing the load speed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>But secondary classes usually have ugly names and are hard to understand!</strong></p>\n<p>\tNot at all. We used basic english for each class name. Below, you&#39;ll see all of them, explained carefuly. Throught the documentation we&#39;ll mention exact places where you can suse them with great ease and where they trully rock!</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tControl Classes</h2>\n<p>\t<strong>disabled -</strong> will display:none ( hide ) the element you add this class to. Great use in header / menu elements or when you beta test an element and want to remove it from screen without having to delete it. It&#39;s great for learning.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>close-menu -&nbsp; </strong>adding this class ot any item of any menu will close that menu&nbsp; when tapped. Applies to menus, walkthrough-boxes, action-sheets or any element that uses menus.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>default-link</strong> - if you plan on using external links in the item, meaning, any link that uses www&nbsp; or http or https or anything external you will have to add this class .This class will bypass the AJAX activation and allow accesing external links. Otherwise, you&#39;ll get an endless loader icon on the screen.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tTypography Secondary Classes</h2>\n<p>\tThese can be added to text elemements to change their colors, sizes and font weights. Say for example you want a heading to be red, but you need it on multiple pages, in different sizes. Rather than creating a tone of CSS for that, you just add the following secondary classes.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>center-text - </strong>aligns text to center</p>\n<p>\t<strong>right-text -</strong> aligns text to right</p>\n<p>\t<strong>left-text -</strong> aligns text to left</p>\n<p>\t---</p>\n<p>\t<strong>capitalize - </strong>will capitalize your font, Making It Look Like This</p>\n<p>\t<strong>uppercase -&nbsp; </strong>will uppecase your font, MAKING IT LOOK LIKE THIS</p>\n<p>\t<strong>lowercase -&nbsp; </strong>will lowercase your font, making it look like this</p>\n<p>\t<strong>thin - </strong>will make your font the thinest possible weight</p>\n<p>\t<strong>thiner -</strong> will make your font a bit thiner than the default value.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>regular - </strong>will make strong text look like normal text</p>\n<p>\t<strong>regularbold -</strong> will make headings look less bold.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>bold </strong>- will make text bold</p>\n<p>\t<strong>ultrabold -</strong> will make text the boldest possible variation</p>\n<p>\t---</p>\n<p>\t<strong>small-text -</strong> will make the font-size of a text 12 pixels, and adjust line height</p>\n<p>\t<strong>smaller-text -&nbsp; </strong>will make the font-size of a text a bit smaller than the default one, and adjust line height</p>\n<p>\t<strong>larger-text -</strong> will make your text 26 pixels ( a bit larger than the h1 tag )</p>\n<p>\t<strong>large-text -&nbsp; </strong>will make your text 28 pixels ( a bit more larger than the h1 tag )</p>\n<p>\t<strong>huge-text </strong>- will make your text 30 pixels, very, very large.</p>\n<p>\t---</p>\n<p>\t<strong>boxed-text - </strong>will automatically center your text and limit it to 80% of the screen width</p>\n<p>\t<strong>boxed-text-small -</strong> will automatically center your text and limit it to 200 px ( most screens are 320 - 340px )</p>\n<p>\t<strong>boxed-text-large - </strong>will automatically center your text and limit it to 300 px ( most screens are 320 - 340px )</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Icon size manipulation and text size manipulation</strong>.</p>\n<p>\tMaybe our font sizes are perfect for you, but you need something that&#39;s right inbetween for a heading. Normally, you go to CSS and create that class. But there&#39;s no need. We created some font classes that will alow you to edit your text, but most importantly, these have been built to manipulate the size of font-awesome icons. These are placed in the header, footer, and other places, and being able to edit their sizes in just one place will be incredibly useful in the navigation and header designs.</p>\n<p>\tSimply add the following classes to any text or icon element to alter it&#39;s size without having to edit any css. <strong>font-10, font-11, font-12, font-13, font-14, font-15, font-16, font-17, font-18, font-19, font-20, font-21.</strong></p>\n<p>\tFor example, let&#39;s say you have a facebook icon inside a paragraph. By default, our font size for paragraphs is set to 13 pixels. You can increase both the size of the text and icon by adding the secondary class to the paragraph or simply adding it to the icon will change it&#39;s size alone.</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-facebook font-15&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The icon will be 15 pixels, i&#39;m just 13 pixels&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<h2>\n\t&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>\n\tPosition &amp; Column Secondary Classes</h2>\n<p>\tThese classes are used to affect the margin bottom or top of an element or their overall position on the screen</p>\n<p>\t<strong>top-VALUE / bottom-VALUE </strong>- you can replace value with:</p>\n<p>\t<strong>0</strong> - 0px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\t<strong>5 </strong>- 5px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\t<strong>10 </strong>- 10px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\t<strong>15 </strong>- 15px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\t<strong>20 </strong>- 20px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\t<strong>25 </strong>- 25px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\t<strong>30 </strong>- 35px margin top/bottom</p>\n<p>\tIn previous templates we used 15px increments, but , our customers requested we add even more granular control over the top and bottom margin, therefore, this version allows you a much finer top and bottom control.</p>\n<p>\tThese will affect the top or bottom margin depending on which you choose.</p>\n<p>\tFor example, a paragraph has the bottom margin of 30 pixels. Maybe you want that to be smaller or no existant at all in certain places. Maybe you want to give it a maximum top margin over another element. Then you would do this</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;p class=&quot;bottom-0 top-30&quot;&gt;I no longer have a bottom margins but I have 30pixels margin top&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tImage Effects</h2>\n<p>\t<strong>polaroid-effect / polaroid-effect-small</strong> - will add a polaroid white padding to the image</p>\n<p>\t<strong>responsive-image&nbsp;</strong>- will make the image be full width, while maintaing it&#39;s aspect ratio</p>\n<p>\t<strong>preload-image</strong> - this class is added to images you want to preload</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;img src=&quot;location_to_empty_image.png&quot; data-src=&quot;location_to_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; class=&quot;preload-image&quot;&gt;</pre>\n<h2>\n\t&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>\n\tColor and Background Color Classes</h2>\n<p>\tColor classes can be used for text elements, but backgrounds can be used for most elements shown in the page.</p>\n<p>\tBackground secondary classes are - <strong>bg-COLOR_NAME-light / bg-COLOR_NAME-dark </strong></p>\n<p>\tColor secondary classes are -<strong> color-COLOR_NAME</strong></p>\n<p>\tBorder secondary classes are - <strong>border-COLOR_NAME-light / border-COLOR_NAME-dark </strong></p>\n<p>\tThe available colors to replace <strong>COLOR_NAME</strong> are : <strong>teal</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, <strong>green2</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>blue2</strong>, <strong>magenta</strong>, <strong>night</strong>, <strong>yellow</strong>, <strong>yellow2</strong>, <strong>orange</strong>, <strong>red</strong>, <strong>pink</strong>, <strong>magenta</strong>, <strong>brown</strong>, <strong>brown2</strong>.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tYou can also easily manipulate the &quot;intensity&quot; of colors. For example, our template uses dark text on light background, mostly all over the item. So for example, let&#39;s say you have a paragraph that you decide to make pure black</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;p class=&quot;color-black SECONDARY_CLASS&quot;&gt;I&#39;m a black colored text&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tBut you decide, that black is too dark for your white background and you want to alter it&#39;s contrast. Normally, you&#39;d go in the CSS and alter the class or create a special class for it. Well, you don&#39;t have to. You can easily modify the intensity of the color by modifying it&#39;s opacity. Replace the <strong>SECONDARY</strong><strong>_CLASS</strong> with the following classes, a larger number means more opaque, a smaller number means more transparent, the classes are: <strong>opacity-10, opacity-20, opacity-30, opacity-40, opacity-50, opacity-60, opacity-70, opacity-80, opacity-90.</strong></p>\n<p>\tThis can also be aplied to other colors in the item, or to entire elemenets. Using for example opacity-90 will show a very dark shade of gray, but using opacity-50 will show a lighter one. If you want to have a small text that is bearly visible, then you simply use opacity-30 small-text. Simple, right?</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tOverlays.</h2>\n<p>\tThroughout our template you&#39;ll see overlay classes. These have the ability to darken or lighten the text behind them, but they can also change colors.</p>\n<p>\tThe default overlay classes are <strong>overlay-dark</strong> (80% black), <strong>overlay-gradient </strong>(top light, bottom dark ) and <strong>overlay-light</strong> ( 75% white), but, you can do some amazing things with reusable clases. Imagine you&#39;d want a slider to have 5 different overlays, and you&#39;d only have the overlays above, that would mean a lot of css, right? Correct! Using our method, you&#39;ll be done in no time!</p>\n<p>\tPlease note, the structure below is just for demo purposes. Use the overlays in their designeated places as shown thoghout the documentation</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;overlay overlay-dark&quot;&gt;I am the default dark overlay, I&#39;m 80% black opacity&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;overlay bg-black opacity-50&quot;&gt;I am a custom overlay, I&#39;m black, with 50% opacity&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;overlay bg-red-dark opacity-70&quot;&gt;I am a custom overlay, I&#39;m red with 70 opacity&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tNow, you&#39;ll see we use these secondary classes in almost every location of the template. This is makes it easier for you to customize elements, give them your personal feel and look, or just use them as we left them and as the demo you love and purchased for exists.</p>\n<p>\tWe give you the demo design + the uncanny ability to customize every element!</p>\n"},{"title": "Structure","id": "structure","content": "<p>\tAppeca has a complex yet easy structure, built around the idea of extreme flexibility, we created 3 main wrappers.

You&#39;ll see this alot throughout Appeca. The content class is used to make left and right paddings so your content doesn&#39;t stick to the end of your device. When the content class is not set, that element is full width, when you place a content class, everything inside it will automatically be spaced from the left and right side of the screen.</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Content that is not full width will be here --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title": "Highlights & Logos","id": "highlights_logos","content": "<p>\tIn the demos, you saw our page has multiple highlights.

Due to the fact that UltraMobile has highlights, the logo we used in the demo depends on the color of the highlight. Let&#39;s explain.</p>\n<p>\tIn style.css at the top you will find all the highlights. Let&#39;s say we want to change the logo for highlight-red. Open style.css and at the very top locate this code</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n.highlight-red .header-light .header-logo{background-image:url(../images/logo-dark-red.png);}\n.highlight-red .header-dark .header-logo{background-image:url(../images/logo-light-red.png);}\n.highlight-red .footer-light .footer-logo{background-image:url(../images/logo-dark-red.png);}\n.highlight-red .footer-dark .footer-logo{background-image:url(../images/logo-light-red.png);}\n.highlight-red .menu-dark .sidebar-logo a{background-image:url(../images/logo-light-red.png);}\n.highlight-red .menu-light .sidebar-logo a{background-image:url(../images/logo-dark-red.png);}\n</pre>\n<p>\tIn the code above, replace the destination to the logo with the destination to your own logo.</p>\n<p>\tNow, we need to set the sizes for the logo inside the header, sidebar and footer. In order to do that, in style.css at the very bottom you will see this code.</p>\n<pre class=\"css\">\n.sidebar-logo a{\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size:136px 16px;\n    height:20px;\n}\n\n.header .header-logo, .footer .footer-logo{\n    background-size:115px 13px;\n    width:115px;\n    margin-left:-57px;\n}\n\n.footer .footer-logo{\n    background-size:175px 20px;\n    position:relative;\n    width:100%;\n    height:20px;\n    left:auto;\n    margin:0 auto;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>\tReplace the background-size of each parameter seen above with <strong>half</strong> the size of your logo. This will maintain a crisp, elegant retina look. IF needed, increase the hight parameter as well.</p>\n<p>\tAnd that&#39;s it! That&#39;s how your replace the logos!</p>\n"},{"title": "Header","id": "header","content": "<p>\tFrom past experience we learned that customers like insane flexibility over the header.

It has the ID header which we use to manipulate when moving the menu.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>YOUR_HEADER_STYLE</strong> can be replaced with</p>\n<p>\t<strong>header-logo-left</strong> - will place the logo on the left side of the header, 4 icons right</p>\n<p>\t<strong>header-logo-right</strong> - will place the logo on the right side of the header, 4 icons left</p>\n<p>\t<strong>header-logo-center</strong> - will place the logo in the center, 2 icons left, 2 icons right.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>header-logo-app</strong> - will place 1 icon to the left, the header logo and 3 icons to the right.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>HEADER-COLOR&nbsp; </strong>- can be replaced with header-light, header-dark, or if you feel experimental, check out the background color secondary classes and have fun!</p>\n<p>\tOn pages where you use header cards, these get added inside the <strong>page-content </strong>class. You can hide the header and make it show again by adding the class <strong>hide-header-card </strong>to the header.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tHeader with Left, Center or Right&nbsp; Logo</h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n    &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot; class=&quot;header-logo-VALUE header-dark&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-4&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-3&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-2&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-1&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>\tReplace header-logo-value with header-logo-left, header-logo-center or header-logo-right to switch the style of the header.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Header with App Style design.</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot; class=&quot;header-logo-app header-dark&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-title disabled&quot;&gt;Header Styles&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-logo disabled&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-1&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-2&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-3&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;header-icon header-icon-4&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Icon Here--&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tIn this style, you&#39;ll create the app like logo. The icon to the left, followed by the logo or page title, then another 3 icons. To choose between the header logo or a page title, simply remove the <strong>disabled</strong> secondary class from the one you want to show.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tAdding Back Button To Header Icon</h3>\n<p>\tYou can make any header icon act like a back button, and it&#39;s simple, give it the secondary class name of <strong>back-button</strong> and you&#39;re good to go! In order to test it, first you&#39;ll have to navigate to that page from another page, then click back. For example, go to home, then click page, then inside page click back. If you open page directly and click back, there&#39;s nowhere to go back to!</p>\n"},{"title": "Menus","id": "menus","content": "<p>\tWe&#39;re excited and proud to show off our menu system. UltraMobile uses the most complex and easy to use off-canvas system on the entire Envato Marketplace. No other menu can do anything even remotely close to what ours can do. What is that you say? Everything! You can deploy sidebars, header dropdowns, footer fly ups, modals, and even create off canvas custom elements with INSANE ease!</p>\n<p>\tFirst, let&#39;s explain the method behind it.</p>\n<p>\tWe use data-attributes. This allows us to tag any menu from a data-class then target the identified of the box you want to animate. In simple language, you add a data-deploy-menu=&quot;your-menu-1&quot; to any button, and then id=&quot;your-menu-1&quot; to a menu box, and voila! Together with a few clases, that menu will activate.</p>\n<p>\tLet&#39;s start off!</p>\n<h4>\n\tCreating any Menu</h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;a data-menu=&quot;menu-1&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Deploy Menu&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe code above has the data-menu=&quot;menu-1&quot;. This is a unique name, be sure you use it only for a single menu style, for example, data-menu=&quot;menu-1&quot; and id=&quot;menu-1&quot; are the unique identifiers for our sidebar menu.</p>\n<p>\tIf you plan on creating another menu, you can used menu-2 or any unique name you want, including you-are-an-awesome-custoemer. As long as it matches the ID of the menu, it will open it.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Creating Sidebars</strong></p>\n<p>\tIn UltraMobile we&#39;ve created 5 different sidebar variations, each with a different effect. These are easy to implement and can be done by follwing this basic structure ( more in the next chapter on how to create menu items )</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div id=&quot;menu-1&quot; class=&quot;menu-sidebar menu-COLOR menu-sidebar-POSITIOON menu-sidebar-TYPE&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;menu-scroll&quot;&gt;\n       &lt;!--More in the next chapter--&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;    \n</pre>\n<p>\tLine 1 generates the menu. This has the id identical to the data-menu that you want to target.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>menu-COLOR</strong> can be replaced with menu-dark or menu-light</p>\n<p>\t<strong>menu-sidebar-POSITION</strong> can be replaced with menu-sidebar-left or menu-sidebar-right</p>\n<p>\t<strong>menu-sidebar-TYPE</strong> can be replaced with menu-sidebar-3d, menu-sidebar-reveal, menu-sidebar-push, menu-sidebar-over or menu-sidebar-parallax.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>NOTE</strong>: You can have any number of sidebars on each side but you <strong>CANNOT</strong> open a sidebar from a sidebar. The transitions required to generate these sidebars will cause errors. <strong>Sidebars can only be opened from the page-content or outside the page content, but not from another sidebar.</strong></p>\n<p>\tLine 2 is the menu-scroll. This is essential to allow your menu to scroll in case your content exceeds the screen height.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Creating Flyin Menus / Action Boxes</strong></p>\n<p>\tA good example of a flyin menu is the share button located in the footer. These are incredibly easy to do. You can target them exactly like you target the sidebars, using the data-menu attribute. And the data-menu must be identical to the ID of the menu</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div id=&quot;menu-1&quot; class=&quot;menu-flyin&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;menu-flyin-content&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tLine 1 generates the menu. The class menu-flyin is necessary</p>\n<p>\tLine 2 generates the internal content class. Add all your content here. Check the <strong>component-action-boxes.html</strong> page for copy paste examples of these menus.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title": "Menu Structure","id": "menu_structure","content": "<p>\tThis structure applies to the sidebars. These go inside the menu-scroll class presented in the previous chapter.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Sidebar Social Icons</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-icons&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;font-10 fa-fw fab fa-facebook-f&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;font-10 fa-fw fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;font-10 fa-fw fa fa-phone&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;font-11 fa-fw far fa-envelope&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;close-menu&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;font-10 fa-fw fa fa-times&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe sidebar socials allow the use of 5 different icons. The last icon we used is there to close the menu. You can close any menu on the screen by adding the class <strong>close-menu</strong> to any button or link.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Sidebar Logo</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n    &lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-logo&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;em&gt;Powerful Mobile Solutions&lt;/em&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>\tThis section creates the sidebar logo. You can replace your tagline with text and the logo can be replaced with your image as explained in the <strong>Logos &amp; Highlights Chapter </strong>above.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Sidebar Dividers</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-separator&quot;&gt;Let&#39;s Get Social&lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>\tThe sidebar divider is just a decoration / line</p>\n<p>\tThe sidebar separator is a small text that you can add to create different chapters for your sidebar.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Creating Menu Items</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;menu-items menu-icons&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-star&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;menu-item-active&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-star&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Homepages&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; data-submenu=&quot;submenu-1&quot; class=&quot;submenu-has-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-star&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Templates&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;submenu submenu-active&quot; id=&quot;submenu-1&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Store&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe structure above generates the menu items. These are very easy to use. Lets explain</p>\n<p>\tLine 1 creates the menu housing class. This can have the class menu-icons to show the first icon or menu-no-icons to hide the first icon.</p>\n<p>\tLine 2 is a simple menu item. This is not activated.</p>\n<p>\tLine 3 is a simple menu item. This is activeted by adding the class menu-item-active</p>\n<p>\tLine 4 is a simple menu item. Notice that this has the data-attribute <strong>data-submenu=&quot;submenu-1&quot;</strong> this will be used to target the submenu on line 5 that will have the id<strong> </strong>identical with the data-submenu, meaning, submenu-1. The submenu can also have a plus icon if needed. You can add it by replacing submenu-has-numbers with submenu-has-plus.</p>\n<p>\tLine 5 is the submenu itself. This contains basic links for each submenu element. Adding submenu-active to this will make the submenu show as deployed when the page is loaded.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Sidebar Contact Form</strong></p>\n<p>\tThe sidebar contact form and the contact page contact form rely on the same code. Therefore, these cannot be used on the same page. By editing the contact.php file you will be basically editing all contact forms in sidebars and the contact .html page.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title": "Other Menu Elements","id": "other_menu_elements","content": "<p>\tAs we said, the menu structure is incredibly complex and powerful, and we&#39;ll be using it a lot, we&#39;ll explain each feature as we come to it, as most places the menu will be used is in the features pages.
